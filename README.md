2048 Classic Game

We are implementing a 2048 game solver through algorithms.

Abstract:

We created a smaller version of the game 2048. We used the Greedy Algorithm, MiniMax Algorithm, and Random to attempt to get to 2048. We calculated each of the algorithm's best scores to determine which algorithm is the best at solving 2048.

Objectives:
- Recreate a GUI version of 2048
- Created Greedy Algorithm
- Created MiniMax Algorithm
- Created Random Algorithm
- Compare Greedy, MiniMax, and Random Algorithm's best scores
